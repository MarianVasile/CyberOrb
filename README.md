# Cyber Orb

Simple HTML5 mobile demo game built with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) that uses the **Device Orientation** and **Vibration** APIs.

## Class 1

Summary:

Today we're going to go over a few simple examples of what you can achieve with programming, with examples of code that you can adjust to change the outcome. To make it fun, we'll play with the programming of a simple video game, and in the second part we'll draw something on the screen. We'll use two different programming languages, to give you a taste of different ways to write a program. I'll also show you how to build a level for a 2D game.

Now the kind of programming I'm going to present you is rather new, so that by the time you get a job, or maybe just do something for a hobby, your knowledge is not already obsolete.
